## 5. Kotlin

* Made an application loading a set of words with their translation (here the wordlist is in English and the translation in French). 
* The list appears in the main activity (in a drop-down list). 
* When you select a word, its translation appears. 
* A menu allows you either to view the list of words or to arrive on a quiz asking for the entry of 5 words and returning the score.
